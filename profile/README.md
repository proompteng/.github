# proompteng

**what we build**  
proompteng is the operating system for deploying and governing high intelligence agents on kubernetes.

**why now**  
recent multi-billion dollar funding into ai coding and agent platforms shows teams adopting agents faster than they can operationalize them; they need infrastructure that keeps velocity high while policy and observability stay intact.

**our mission**  
deliver a vendor neutral backbone where agents, memory, and tools connect out of the box, giving teams a unified control plane from prototype to production.
